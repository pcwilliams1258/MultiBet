# MultiBet Engine Development Plan

**Last Reviewed: 2025-09-17**

This document consolidates the strategic roadmap and implementation backlog for developing the Unified Multi-Code Bet Generation Engine. The project is structured into five distinct phases with specific, actionable tasks assigned to either the lead architect (`@pcwilliams1258`) or the AI coding agent (`@copilot`).

---

## Phase 1: Scaffolding the Application and Core Engine

**Objective:** Establish a robust, scalable project structure and implement foundational quantitative logic.

| Task ID | User Story | GitHub Issue | Status | Priority | Assignee |
|---------|------------|--------------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1.1 | **As a developer**, I want to initialize a clean project environment so that I can ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase from the start. | #1 | ✅ Complete | High | @pcwilliams1258 |
| 1.2 | **As a developer**, I want to define a core engine architecture with a `BasePredictiveModel` interface so that new models can be added in a plug-and-play fashion. | #2 | 🔄 In Progress | High | @pcwilliams1258 |
| 1.3 | **As a data scientist**, I want to implement foundational quantitative logic for value scoring so that the engine can make initial betting decisions. | #3 | 📋 Planned | High | @pcwilliams1258 |

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] **Formal User Story**: The task is framed as a user story to clarify intent.
- [ ] **Gherkin Feature File**: A `.feature` file exists describing the expected behavior in BDD format.
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all new logic are implemented and passing.
- [ ] **CI Pipeline**: All checks in the CI pipeline (linting, testing, etc.) are passing.
- [ ] **Dry Run Mode**: The feature supports a "Dry Run" mode where applicable.

## Phase 2: Building the Data Pipeline and Feature Store

**Objective:** Build the data infrastructure required to ingest, process, and store data from various sources.

| Task ID | User Story | GitHub Issue | Status | Priority | Assignee |
|---------|------------|--------------|--------|----------|----------|
| 2.1 | **As a data engineer**, I want to architect a two-layer Feature Store so that data is available for both real-time (online) and batch (offline) processing. | #4 | 📋 Planned | High | @pcwilliams1258 |
| 2.2 | **As a data scientist**, I want to ingest market and odds data from The Odds API so that the engine has the necessary data for predictions. | #5 | 📋 Planned | Medium | @copilot |
| 2.3 | **As a data scientist**, I want to engineer high-alpha sports features from Sportradar data so that the predictive models have rich, impactful inputs. | #6 | 📋 Planned | Medium | @pcwilliams1258 |
| 2.4 | **As a data scientist**, I want to engineer high-impact racing features, including sectional times, so that the racing models can make granular predictions. | #7 | 📋 Planned | Medium | @copilot |

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] **Formal User Story**: The task is framed as a user story to clarify intent.
- [ ] **Gherkin Feature File**: A `.feature` file exists describing the expected behavior in BDD format.
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all new logic are implemented and passing.
- [ ] **CI Pipeline**: All checks in the CI pipeline (linting, testing, etc.) are passing.
- [ ] **Dry Run Mode**: The feature supports a "Dry Run" mode where applicable.

## Phase 3: Implementing the Predictive Model Suite

**Objective:** Develop the architectural skeletons for all specialized predictive models.

| Task ID | User Story | GitHub Issue | Status | Priority | Assignee |
|---------|------------|--------------|--------|----------|----------|
| 3.1 | **As a developer**, I want to create the class skeletons for all predictive models so that the core logic can be implemented in a structured and consistent manner. | #8 | 📋 Planned | Medium | @copilot |

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] **Formal User Story**: The task is framed as a user story to clarify intent.
- [ ] **Gherkin Feature File**: A `.feature` file exists describing the expected behavior in BDD format.
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all new logic are implemented and passing.
- [ ] **CI Pipeline**: All checks in the CI pipeline (linting, testing, etc.) are passing.
- [ ] **Dry Run Mode**: The feature supports a "Dry Run" mode where applicable.

## Status Legend

- ✅ **Complete**: Task has been implemented and deployed
