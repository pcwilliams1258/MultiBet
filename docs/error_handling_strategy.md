## 1. API Failures

### 1.1 Timeout Handling

**Strategy:**  
Implement progressive timeout handling with circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures.

**Specifications:**
- **Connection Timeout:** 10 seconds for initial connection establishment
- **Read Timeout:** 30 seconds for data retrieval operations
- **Total Request Timeout:** 45 seconds maximum per API call
- **Circuit Breaker:** Trip after 5 consecutive timeouts, half-open after 60 seconds

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
@timeout_handler(connection=10, read=30, total=45)
@circuit_breaker(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60)
def api_call(endpoint, params):
    # API call implementation
    pass
```

**Fallback Actions:**
- Use cached data if available and within freshness threshold (5 minutes for odds, 1 hour for static data)
- Log timeout event with severity level WARNING
- Return degraded service response with appropriate status indicators

---

### 1.2 Rate Limiting

**Strategy:**  
Implement adaptive rate limiting with exponential backoff and request queuing.

**Specifications:**
- **Rate Limit Detection:** Monitor HTTP 429 responses and rate limit headers
- **Backoff Strategy:** Exponential backoff starting at 1 second, max 300 seconds
- **Request Queuing:** Queue up to 100 requests during rate limit periods
- **Priority Handling:** Prioritize critical odds updates over batch data refreshes

**Implementation Details:**
- **Header Monitoring:** Parse `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers
- **Adaptive Throttling:** Dynamically adjust request frequency based on remaining quota
- **Request Prioritization:** Critical market updates > model predictions > historical data

**Fallback Actions:**
- Queue non-critical requests for delayed processing
- Use stale data with explicit staleness indicators
- Scale down non-essential data refresh operations

---

### 1.3 Server Errors (5xx)

**Strategy:**  
Implement intelligent retry logic with jittered exponential backoff for transient server errors.

**Error Classification:**
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- **502 Bad Gateway:** Immediate retry once, then exponential backoff
- **503 Service Unavailable:** Respect `Retry-After` header if present
- **504 Gateway Timeout:** Treat as timeout error, apply timeout handling

**Retry Configuration:**
- **Base Delay:** 2 seconds
- **Multiplier:** 2.0
- **Jitter:** ±25% random variance
- **Max Attempts:** 3 for critical operations, 1 for batch operations
- **Max Delay:** 60 seconds

**Escalation Triggers:**
- 3 consecutive 5xx errors from the same endpoint
- Error rate exceeding 10% over 5-minute window
- Critical data source unavailable for >15 minutes

---

## 2. Data Validation Errors

### 2.1 Schema Validation

**Strategy:**  
Implement multi-tiered validation with progressive error handling and data quarantine.

**Validation Layers:**
1. **Structural Validation:** Pydantic schema validation for data types and required fields
2. **Business Logic Validation:** Custom validators for domain-specific rules
3. **Statistical Validation:** Outlier detection and range validation
4. **Cross-Reference Validation:** Consistency checks across related data points

**Validation Rules:**
- **Odds Validation:** Decimal odds must be ≥ 1.01 and ≤ 1000.0
- **Probability Validation:** All probabilities must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- **Time Validation:** Event times must be in the future for upcoming events
- **Identifier Validation:** All IDs must follow expected format patterns

---

### 2.2 Data Quality Flagging

**Strategy:**  
Implement a comprehensive data quality scoring system with automated flagging.

**Quality Flags:**
- **RED (Critical):** Data fails basic schema validation - immediate rejection
- **YELLOW (Warning):** Data passes schema but fails business logic validation
- **GREEN (Pass):** Data passes all validation layers

**Flagging Criteria:**
- **Incomplete Data:** Missing critical fields (runner names, odds, event times)
- **Suspicious Values:** Odds outside expected ranges, impossible probabilities
- **Inconsistent Data:** Conflicting information across data sources
- **Stale Data:** Data older than acceptable freshness thresholds

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Completeness Score:** Percentage of required fields populated
- **Consistency Score:** Agreement level across multiple data sources
- **Freshness Score:** Recency of data relative to event timing
- **Accuracy Score:** Historical accuracy of data source

---

### 2.3 Data Quarantine Process

**Strategy:**  
Implement automated quarantine with human review workflows for problematic data.

**Quarantine Triggers:**
- Schema validation failures with unknown field structures
- Business rule violations requiring manual investigation
- Data quality score below 70% threshold
- Repeated validation failures from specific data sources

**Quarantine Workflow:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Move invalid data to quarantine storage
2. **Automated Analysis:** Run diagnostic checks to identify failure patterns
3. **Alert Generation:** Notify data quality team for manual review
4. **Resolution Tracking:** Track time-to-resolution and root cause analysis

**Release Criteria:**
- Manual approval from data quality team
- Successful revalidation against updated schemas
- Root cause resolution documented and implemented

---

### 2.4 Data Rejection Process

**Strategy:**  
Implement clear rejection criteria with comprehensive logging and monitoring.

**Rejection Criteria:**
- **Corrupted Data:** Malformed JSON, encoding errors, truncated responses
- **Obsolete Data:** Data for events that have already concluded
- **Duplicate Data:** Identical records already processed within deduplication window
- **Blacklisted Sources:** Data from sources marked as unreliable

**Rejection Workflow:**
1. **Immediate Rejection:** Discard data without further processing
2. **Detailed Logging:** Record rejection reason, source, and data characteristics
3. **Metrics Collection:** Track rejection rates by source and error type
4. **Automated Alerts:** Trigger alerts if rejection rates exceed thresholds

## 3. Retry Logic

### 3.1 Exponential Backoff Strategy

**Base Configuration:**
- **Initial Delay:** 1 second
- **Backoff Multiplier:** 2.0
- **Maximum Delay:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Jitter Factor:** 25% random variance to prevent thundering herd

**Formula:**
```
delay = min(initial_delay * (multiplier ^ attempt) * (1 + random(-jitter, +jitter)), max_delay)
```

**Retry Categories:**
- **Critical Operations:** Up to 5 attempts (odds updates, live scoring)
- **Standard Operations:** Up to 3 attempts (market data, predictions)
- **Batch Operations:** Up to 2 attempts (historical data, analytics)

---

### 3.2 Transient Failure Classification

**Transient Failures (Retry Enabled):**
- Network connectivity issues (DNS resolution, connection refused)
- Temporary service unavailability (503 errors with Retry-After headers)
- Rate limiting (429 errors)
- Gateway timeouts (504 errors)
- Temporary database lock conflicts

**Permanent Failures (No Retry):**
- Authentication failures (401, 403 errors)
- Data not found (404 errors)
- Client errors (400, 422 errors)
- Method not allowed (405 errors)
- Data corruption or malformed requests

---

### 3.3 Context-Aware Retry Logic

**Time-Sensitive Operations:**
- **Pre-Event Window:** Standard retry logic applies
- **Live Events:** Reduced retry attempts (max 2) with shorter delays
- **Post-Event:** Single retry attempt, then accept failure

**Priority-Based Retry:**
- **High Priority:** Critical odds updates, live scoring data
- **Medium Priority:** Model predictions, market analysis
- **Low Priority:** Historical data backfill, reporting queries

**Resource-Aware Retry:**
- Monitor system resources during retry operations
- Reduce retry frequency if system load exceeds 80%
- Implement graceful degradation under resource constraints
