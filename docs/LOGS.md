# LOGS.md

This document is the official log of all major development tasks completed using the "Glass Box" workflow with GitHub Copilot. It serves as a version-controlled history of the prompts used to generate features, as well as the validation steps taken.

## Template for New Entries

- **GitHub Issue:** (Link to the GitHub Issue, e.g., `https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/issues/123`)
- **Pull Request:** (Link to the Pull Request, e.g., `#145`)

**Final Prompt Chain:**
1. **Prompt 1:** (The initial prompt used to generate the core code for the feature.)
2. **Prompt 2 (Refinement):** (Any follow-up prompts used to refactor, add error handling, improve documentation, etc.)

**AI Explanation Summary:**  
(To be filled by founder after using `/explain` on the final code. A 1-2 sentence summary of the AI's explanation of the code's logic and purpose.)

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Instructed Copilot to generate pytest unit tests based on the acceptance criteria in the issue.
- [ ] (Add specific test cases that were validated, e.g., Test case 1: Positive correlation.)
- [ ] Executed pytest in the terminal.
- [ ] All tests passed successfully before committing the code.

## Part 2: Scaffolding the Application and Core Engine

- **GitHub Issue:** (Link to Issue #1)
- **Pull Request:** (To be filled in upon creation)

**Final Prompt Chain:**
1. **Prompt 1 (Directory Structure):**  
   "Create a directory structure for a Python project. The root directory should contain a `src` directory. Inside `src`, create subdirectories: `core_engine`, `data_pipelines`, `models`, and `tests`. The root should also contain `config` and `data` directories."
2. **Prompt 2 (Version Control):**  
   "Initialize a new Git repository in the current root directory."
3. **Prompt 3 (Git Ignore):**  
   "Generate a standard `.gitignore` file suitable for a Python project."
4. **Prompt 4 (Dependencies):**  
   "Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory. Add: flask, pandas, numpy, redis, google-cloud-bigquery, scikit-learn, catboost, tensorflow, shap, requests, pydantic, pytest, requests-mock."

**AI Explanation Summary:**  
(N/A for file system setup)

**Validation Checklist:**
- [x] Verified that the `src`, `config`, and `data` directories were created correctly.
- [x] Verified that the subdirectories `core_engine`, `data_pipelines`, `models`, and `tests` exist inside `src`.
- [x] Confirmed that a `.gitignore` file was created with appropriate Python-related entries.
- [x] Confirmed that a `requirements.txt` file was created and contains all specified libraries.

## Issue #PM-1 Entry

- **GitHub Issue:** #81
- **Pull Request:** #86

**Final Prompt Chain:**
1.  **Initial Prompt:** "Act as a Senior DevOps Engineer. I am providing you with my repository and a definitive CI/CD strategy document. Your goal is to synchronize the repository with this strategy by reviewing the current state, implementing all required configuration changes, creating knowledge artifacts, and generating clear guides for both the founder and the AI."
2.  **Refinement 1 (Issue Creation):** "Review `docs/PLAN.md` and the issue templates, then create draft GitHub issues for all the implementation tasks required by the new CI/CD strategy."
3.  **Refinement 2 (Documentation Sync):** "Incorporate updates to the branch protection documentation and validation tests into the plan, and create a preparatory issue to track all documentation and planning updates before the main implementation begins."
4.  **Refinement 3 (Consolidation & Finalization):** "Review the `copilot.md` file to ensure no critical architectural context was removed. Merge the essential technical specifications from the original file with the new CI/CD workflow to create a single, definitive guide. Consolidate all steps into a final, sequential implementation plan."

**AI Explanation Summary:**
This work established the foundational documentation required for a major CI/CD overhaul. It involved creating a new, comprehensive strategy document (`CI_CD_STRATEGY.md`) to serve as the project's source of truth for automation. The AI developer guide (`copilot.md`) and Pull Request template were updated to align with a new, more efficient local development workflow using modern tools like Ruff and pre-commit hooks. Finally, the master project plan (`PLAN.md`) was updated to include all the new, specific tasks required to execute this strategy, ensuring the work is tracked and aligned with the project's issue-driven methodology.

**Validation Checklist:**
- [x] Verified that `docs/PLAN.md` was updated with the new `INFRA` and `T-1` tasks.
- [x] Confirmed the creation of the new `docs/CI_CD_STRATEGY.md` file with the full strategy text.
- [x] Checked that `.github/copilot.md` was overwritten with the new, consolidated guide that includes both architectural rules and the CI/CD workflow.
- [x] Ensured `.github/pull_request_template.md` was updated to include the new "Local Checks" item in the PR checklist.
