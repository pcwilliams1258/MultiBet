Enhanced Multi-Bet Engine Roadmap
This document outlines the strategic roadmap for developing the Unified Multi-Code Bet Generation Engine. The project is structured into five distinct epics, each containing a series of user stories that build upon one another to deliver a complete, production-grade system.
Epic 1: Scaffolding the Application and Core Engine
Objective: Establish a robust, scalable project structure and implement foundational quantitative logic.
User Story 2.1: As the founder, I need to initialize the project environment with a clean directory structure, version control, and all necessary dependencies so that development can begin on a solid foundation.
User Story 2.2: As the founder, I need to generate the core engine architecture, including the abstract BasePredictiveModel interface and the CoreEngine orchestrator, to ensure a modular and pluggable system design.
User Story 2.3: As the founder, I need to implement the foundational quantitative logic for value score calculation and initial staking to form the core of the bet identification process.
Epic 2: Building the Data Pipeline and Feature Store
Objective: Build the data infrastructure required to ingest, process, and store data from various sources.
User Story 1.4: As the founder, I need to architect and deploy a two-layer Feature Store (Online/Redis, Offline/BigQuery) and define data schemas to ensure data consistency and performance.
User Story 1.1: As the founder, I need to ingest market and odds data from The Odds API to provide the core pricing information for the engine.
User Story 1.3: As the founder, I need to ingest granular racing statistics, including gear changes and sectional times, from The Racing API and Total Performance Data to create high-alpha racing features.
User Story 1.2: As the founder, I need to ingest granular sports statistics from Sportradar to create high-alpha sports features like 'Average Ruck Speed' and 'Forward-Half Intercepts'.
Epic 3: Implementing the Predictive Model Suite
Objective: Develop the architectural skeletons for all specialized predictive models.
User Story 2.1 (Racing): As the founder, I need to create the RacingConditionalLogitModel class skeleton to handle multi-runner racing predictions.
User Story 2.2 (Sports): As the founder, I need to create the SportsCatBoostClassifier class skeleton for team-based sports predictions.
User Story 2.3 (Player Props): As the founder, I need to create the PlayerTriesNBModel class skeleton for count-based player prop predictions.
User Story 2.4 (Time-Series): As the founder, I need to create the PlayerDisposalsLSTMModel class skeleton to capture time-series dynamics in player performance.
Epic 4: Engineering the Advanced Multi-Bet Engine
Objective: Implement the sophisticated quantitative logic for correlation modeling and dynamic staking.
User Story 3.1 & 3.2: As the founder, I need to implement a quantitative correlation engine, using a Student's t-Copula, to accurately price Same-Game Multis by modeling the dependence between outcomes.
User Story 3.3: As the founder, I need to implement dynamic Fractional Kelly staking, which adjusts the stake size based on a model's confidence score for a given bet, to optimize capital allocation.
Epic 5: Establishing the Continuous Improvement Framework
Objective: Build the MLOps and validation frameworks to ensure the project's long-term viability and performance.
User Story 4.1: As the founder, I need to automate the logging and calculation of Closing Line Value (CLV) for every recommended bet to have a definitive KPI for model performance.
User Story 4.2: As the founder, I need to integrate model explainability (XAI) using SHAP to understand model predictions and feed a confidence score into the dynamic staking engine.
User Story 4.3: As the founder, I need to scaffold an automated retraining pipeline to combat model drift and ensure the predictive models adapt to evolving market conditions.
